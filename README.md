# d.js-v14-Mini-Games-Commands
This repository contains nearly all of the games offered in the discord-gamecord package.

### `‚ùì` **Purpose:**
This is a collection of _(almost)_ all games available in the discord-gamecord package. Normally, all of the code from the documentary would be used for individual commands, but by using the `.addChoices` function like I did here, you can save a **_ton_** of command spaces!

### `‚ùó` **Requirements:**
For these commands to work, you must install the discord-gamecord package.
**‚§∑** Paste in terminal: `npm i discord-gamecord`

### `üîß` **Commands:**
- /games-singleplayer **‚ûú** Allows users to play 13 single-player mini-games.
- /games-multiplayer  **‚ûú** Allows users to play any of the 3 provided multi-player games with another user.

### `üí≥` **Credits:**
- Credits to Aniket#0729 (Discord ID: 474255126228500480) for creating the `discord-gamecord` npm package. Without them, these mini-games would not have been possible!
- Credits to nz#0708 (Discord ID: 346016772664721418) for providing the code for the single-player rock-paper-scissors game.
